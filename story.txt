Medical tecnologies are very developing very fast today.


Especially after the discovery of CRISPR, which is an amazing gene that can be reverse engineered, potentially yielding new cancer treatments and other medical miracles that before were only found in science fiction.



But medical research is faced by many challenges such as deciphering of the human DNA/genes. Humans have 
been deciphering DNA sequence since the discovery of DNA, but we have only deciphered a small fraction.

On the other hand, the results has shown that the average age of death has significantly increased compared to one hundred years ago, when people have an average death age between 40 - 50
so these advanced techologies make our lives better.


However, a big concern for CRISPR would be that it is not perfect. It can inadvertently wipe out and rearrange large swaths of DNA in ways that may imperil human health.

Also, it has some side effects on human appearance. It may cause rearrangement of genes from nose, eyes, ears or anything else. Therefore, people may tend to grow ears from nose.

With a powerful technology like that, it's able to produce a wide range of different outcomes.
